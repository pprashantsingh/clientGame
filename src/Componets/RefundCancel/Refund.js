    </p>
    <p>

 does not charge Users a fee for accessing the ROCKETBET
 Platform and for certain Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>(b) Funding Accounts:</strong> If you play games integrated in a Competition without depositing KASH into your Account for that Competition, then you are a “Non-KASH User” with respect to such Competition. However, if you play in a KASH Competition that requires an entry paid in U.S. Dollars, then you are a “KASH User”. The funds in your Account will be held as “Deposit KASH” in your ROCKETBET
 Wallet. An account may be funded with “Deposit KASH” in one of two ways: 
    </p>
    <p>(1) By a “KASH User” who deposits KASH into the user’s Account; or </p>
    <p>(2) ByROCKETPE, this may, from time to time and in its sole discretion, credit Deposit KASH into your ROCKETBET
 Wallet.</p>
    <p> If ROCKETBET
 credits Deposit KASH into your ROCKETBET
 Wallet, that Deposit KASH credit will be available for use only after the funds deposited by a ‘KASH User’ have been fully utilized. Unless otherwise specified at the time, any Deposit KASH that is credited by ROCKETBET
 to your ROCKETBET
 Wallet will automatically expire after two weeks from the date of credit.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of deposit of KASH and achieving a positive account balance, our payment partners may require you to submit your applicable Payment Information for processing. “Payment Information” includes without limitation your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and billing addresses for billing and notification.
